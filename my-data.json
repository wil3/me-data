		"bio": "Hello world! My name is Wil Koch (pronounced 'cook') and I am a third year PhD student at Boston University advised by Azer Bestavros. I study autonomous malware (a.k.a. bots) and developing defenses for their attacks. Before returning to academia I was involved in a few start-ups and worked as a software engineer. I enjoy writing code and working on software projects. When I'm not behind a screen, depending on the season I'll be out snowboarding, surfing or getting lost somewhere in the woods. ",
